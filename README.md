# Quick Instructions before I clean it up

First thing you need to do is create a bot at https://discord.com/developers and invite it to your server(s)

Next, edit your .env file for your bot token and port. (I believe you'll have to create it I can setup formatting soon but basically create a file named .env in the server folder and add like
BOTTOKEN: (token)
Port: (port)

You will want to leave the port mostly the same for cloud.)

Next, CD into the server folder, and do ```npm install```, then ```npm start```.
Or alternatively, make a fork of this repo and use something like render.com to cloud host it for free. (Like I am.)
